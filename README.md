# ML Model Playbook

This repository is a structured playbook for building, understanding, and applying core Machine Learning models and concepts.

It contains:

1. Model implementations:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost

2. Core ML concepts:
   - Evaluation metrics
   - Feature engineering
   - ML pipelines and data leakage prevention

Each folder contains:
- A Jupyter notebook with minimal, clean experiments
- A notes.md file with concise explanations:
  - When to use a method
  - Why it works
  - Assumptions and limitations
  - Failure modes and tradeoffs

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong modeling intuition
- Practice industry-grade ML workflows
- Serve as a reference for real-world ML problem solving
