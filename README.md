# ML Model Playbook

This repository contains minimal, focused implementations of core Machine Learning models.

Each model is structured to answer these questions:
- When to use / when not
- Core intuition
- Loss function
- Optimization method
- Assumptions
- Bias vs variance
- Key hyperparameters
- Data requirements
- Suitable metrics
- Failure modes
- What to try next

Each folder contains:
- One Jupyter notebook: model implementation + small experiments
- One notes.md: crisp answers to the above questions
